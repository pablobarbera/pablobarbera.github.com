Computing a simple average for a variable across groups can take minutes when a researcher is working with government records, large-scale survey studies or social media datasets with millions of rows. The goal of this workshop is to learn how to overcome challenges associated to massive-scale online databases. We will learn the basics of SQL, a language designed to query relational databases that is currently employed by most tech companies; and how to use it from R using the DBI package. From all the available options to store online databases, we will focus on BigQuery, which relies on Google’s infrastructure to efficiently store and query databases at scale. We will learn how to process, upload, and query databases of up to a billion rows in a matter of seconds, and how to export the results of our queries.</div></p>

Although this data is easily accessible, in most cases it is available in an unstructured format, which makes its analysis challenging. The goal of this course is to gain the skills necessary to automate the process of downloading, cleaning, and reshaping web and social data using the R programming language for statistical computing. We will cover all the most common scenarios: scraping data available in multiple pages or behind web forms, interacting with APIs and RSS feeds such as those provided by most media outlets, collecting data from Facebook and Twitter, extracting text and table data from PDF files, and manipulating datasets into a format ready for analysis. The course will follow a "learning-by-doing" approach, with short theoretical sessions followed by "data challenges" where participants will need to apply new methods.</div></p>

It will be structured around techniques to deal with the 3 V's of Big Data: volume, variety, and veracity. First, we will cover the basics of parallel programming and cloud computing to analyse large-scale datasets.

The course lays a theoretical foundation for text analysis but mainly takes a very practical and applied approach, so that students learn how to apply these methods in actual research. The common focus across all methods is that they can be reduced to a three-step process: first, identifying texts and units of texts for analysis; second, extracting from the texts quantitatively measured features—such as coded content categories, word counts, word types, dictionary counts, or parts of speech—and converting these into a quantitative matrix; and third, using quantitative or statistical methods to analyse this matrix in order to generate inferences about the texts or their authors. The course systematically covers these methods in a logical progression, with a practical, hands-on approach where each technique will be applied using appropriate software to real texts.</div></p>

Our main goal is to teach you the basics of creating and consuming research in the social sciences, and international relations in particular. The course will lead you through conceptualization and theory construction, the derivation of testable hypotheses, and how to use data analysis methods to evaluate these hypotheses. We will cover causal inference, observation and measurement, ethics of social science research, and quantitative research methods.  We will also discuss the way in which academic articles in the social sciences are written, and how they should be read. This course includes some introductory statistics, and requires use of Excel for some class assignments. These include descriptive statistics, contingency tables, correlation analysis, and significance tests for relationships between variables from different quantitative datasets.

(4) Understand what additional training and skills you will need to conduct research, and the thorough grounding necessary for self-teaching. (5) Provide you with a working knowledge of R to facilitate 2-4.</br></br> The course is roughly divided in three parts. Weeks 1-5 focus on learning description and inference for a single variable. We will cover the basics of probability theory and hypothesis testing. Weeks 6-11 introduce the workhorse of quantitative analysis – linear regression. This part will focus on the derivation, estimation, and interpretation of the linear model, and then solutions to violations of the linear regression assumptions. The final weeks of the semester will discuss more advanced topics, including techniques for causal inference, matrix algebra, time series analysis, and data visualization.

The course will begin with an overview of the history of the EU, and the key theories and
debates on European integration. We will draw on this historical and theoretical
background to discuss its governing institutions and to examine the main aspects of
legislative, executive, and judicial politics in the Union, as well as the role of citizens,
political parties, and interest groups. During the second half of the semester, we will
focus on some of the important questions regarding the future of the EU: the potential
enlargement of the Union, the viability of the single currency, and the EU’s role as a
